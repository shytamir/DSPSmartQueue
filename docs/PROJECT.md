# Project status and steering

## Authority

This is the sole authoritative record of current phase, epic/story status,
implementation readiness, and acceptance. Update those facts here only. The
[roadmap](management/ROADMAP.md) defines work, exclusions, and completion criteria;
the [kickoff](KICKOFF.md) defines the product contract. Other documents provide
instructions or dated evidence, not parallel status records. Current owner
instructions take precedence.

## Current phase

The two-epic, seven-story prototype delivery is complete. The owner accepted the
identified handoff after passing all live observations and cleanup. No planned
stories remain open.

Repository scaffolding and local preparation are complete. The
[preparation evidence](REFERENCE-BASELINE.md) records static inspection and toolkit
checks; [local development](LOCAL-DEVELOPMENT.md) documents reusable commands.
The adapter compiles and its offline binding, mapping, interaction, and lifecycle/
recovery checks passed for the handoff build. Owner-reported live feasibility
validation passed. The GitHub workflow runs offline logic/binding fixtures; private
package creation uses the local real-reference build. Installation and live
observations were performed by the owner, not the agent.

## Work tracking

| Epic | Status |
| --- | --- |
| SQ-1: Safe integrated queue adapter | Complete; owner accepted |
| SQ-2: Identified prototype delivery and feasibility | Complete; owner accepted |

| Story | Status | Completion evidence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [SQ-1.1](management/ROADMAP.md#sq-11--minimal-plugin-foundation) | Complete | [Compilation, metadata and negative checks](implementation/SQ-1.1.md) |
| [SQ-1.2](management/ROADMAP.md#sq-12--identify-visible-requests) | Complete | [Read-only mapping and focused checks](implementation/SQ-1.2.md) |
| [SQ-1.3](management/ROADMAP.md#sq-13--present-and-operate-the-same-task) | Complete | [Integration, boundary checks and limits](implementation/SQ-1.3.md) |
| [SQ-1.4](management/ROADMAP.md#sq-14--recover-and-restore-native-consistency) | Complete | [Recovery, cleanup checks and live observation handoff](implementation/SQ-1.4.md) |
| [SQ-2.1](management/ROADMAP.md#sq-21--repeatable-identified-prototype-build) | Complete | [Build identity, clean checkout and failure checks](implementation/SQ-2.1.md) |
| [SQ-2.2](management/ROADMAP.md#sq-22--prototype-package-and-owner-procedure) | Complete | [Package inspection and procedure coverage](implementation/SQ-2.2.md) |
| [SQ-2.3](management/ROADMAP.md#sq-23--owner-feasibility-result) | Complete | [Owner acceptance report](#owner-acceptance) |

Record concise evidence against each story's definition of done before marking it
complete. Activation identifies the next work; it is not completion evidence.
Plugin identity is defined in `src/DSPSmartQueue/Plugin.cs`; target framework and
initial binding verification are recorded in SQ-1.1's evidence.

## Owner handoff

- Procedure: [owner feasibility procedure](OWNER-PROCEDURE.md), also enclosed in the ZIP.
- Local artifact: `artifacts/package/DSPSmartQueue-0.1.0-639767658c41-B257B3F2B504.zip`.
- Inspection record: the adjacent `DSPSmartQueue-0.1.0-639767658c41-B257B3F2B504.zip.inspection.json`.
- Version: `0.1.0`; clean source revision: `639767658c417a676626b05c4c8ac2757e9c3809`.
- ZIP SHA256: `B257B3F2B50411CD346EDF69F4794E67E9FF3F199577FB25CE78BA6D511C3B87`.
- DLL SHA256: `A6AD76921FD7EC94B8F0A69A3C742CF01493CD5B32A24E0787803E9D6D669F04`.

This identifies the accepted handoff, not a future rebuild. Source changes after
that revision do not alter the archived ZIP.

## Owner acceptance

On 2026-09-09, the owner reported the following results for the identified handoff
and explicitly confirmed: "Live acceptance passes, the story is done."

| Observation | Owner result |
| --- | --- |
| Display (step 1) | Pass |
| Native continuity and hover (step 2) | Pass |
| Selection and recipe grid (step 3) | Pass |
| Out-of-order cancellation and feedback (step 4) | Pass |
| Selection after advancement (step 5) | Pass |
| Produce, keyboard controls, reopening (step 6) | Pass |
| Subsequent session (step 7) | Pass |
| Cleanup without plugin | Pass |

No failures were observed. The owner also marked package identity, build identity,
and environment checks as passing. The reply did not restate the full game build,
other-mod list, or handcraft upgrades; no specific values are inferred here.
Acceptance applies to this handoff under the owner's tested conditions, not a
broader compatibility matrix. The automated evidence for the same source and DLL
is linked under SQ-2.2 and retained with the package.

## Delivery boundary

Agents perform repository implementation, static inspection, and offline checks.
The owner accepted prototype feasibility for the identified handoff. GitHub
release and Thunderstore publication are not authorized; pushing repository work
to main does not change that boundary.
